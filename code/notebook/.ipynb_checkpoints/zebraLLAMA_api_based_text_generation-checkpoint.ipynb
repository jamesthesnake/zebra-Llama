      "Context: The excerpt discusses the challenges individuals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) face in obtaining a correct diagnosis and treatment, including dismissive attitudes from healthcare professionals. It also highlights common comorbid diagnoses experienced by individuals with EDS and how these impact their daily lives. The excerpt further explores how individuals cope with physical limitations, isolation, and self-doubt, as well as the strategies they employ to manage their symptoms and maintain a sense of normalcy.(Ref: 10.1002/ajmg.c.31935). The section discusses Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a group of genetically transmitted connective tissue disorders that affect collagen synthesis. It includes a case report of a Colombian woman with myopathic EDS and multiple comorbidities, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment. The prevalence of different types of EDS, such as classical EDS and hypermobile EDS, is also discussed based on current literature and studies in the field. The section emphasizes the need for clinical, molecular, neuropsychological, and psychological assessments to improve treatment choices and outcomes for patients with EDS.(Ref: 10.3390/genes13112118). The section discusses the characterization of pain in patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and its impact on their quality of life. It also covers the diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and how it differs from other forms of EDS. The challenges in diagnosing EDS, particularly the hypermobile form, and the tools available for diagnosis are also addressed. The section highlights the prevalence of pain in EDS patients, the different causes of pain in the syndrome, and the importance of proper evaluation and treatment. Additionally, it provides an overview of the classification of EDS, the diagnostic criteria for classical EDS, and the clinical features of hypermobile EDS.(Ref: 10.3390/healthcare11070936). This section provides an overview of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by tissue fragility of the skin, ligaments, blood vessels, and internal organs. It discusses the different subtypes of EDS, including classical EDS, hypermobility EDS, vascular EDS, kyphoscoliosis EDS, arthrochalasia, and Dermatospraxis, highlighting the symptoms and organ involvement of each subtype. The challenges in diagnosing EDS, the prevalence of the disorder, and the life-altering complications associated with EDS, such as vascular and orthopedic events, are also addressed. The importance of early recognition and appropriate management to prevent devastating outcomes is emphasized.(Ref: 10.1155/2013/764659). The section discusses the evolution of understanding of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) in terms of classification and diagnosis, challenges in diagnosing EDS in childhood, variability in prevalence estimates for different types of EDS, clinical presentations, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of EDS. It also mentions the overlap between hEDS and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) and the changing perception of EDS prevalence over the past two decades. Key entities mentioned include different types of EDS (cEDS, hEDS, vEDS), genetic causes, clinical criteria, prevalence estimates, and the Villefranche classification.(Ref: 2020/The Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes-annotated). \n",
